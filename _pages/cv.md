Education
======
* Ph.D in Mathematics, University of Houston, 2021
* B.S. in Mathematics, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2016
* B.S. in Chemical Engineering, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, 2016

Work experience
======

* Data Scientist I, Project Management Institute; July 2021 – Present
  * Upgraded cohort Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) model to a probabilistic model that predicts individual CLV
using survival functions and historic transaction data. Uncovered similar lifetime patterns across segments.
  * Infrastructure transformation: Built PoC CI/CD pipelines (unit testing, code quality checks, Docker containerization) for deploying CLV to Azure Kubernetes Services that served as template for all PMI projects.
  * Supervisor: Professor Git

* Fall 2015: Research Assistant
  * Github University
  * Duties included: Merging pull requests
  * Supervisor: Professor Hub
  

• 
• 
• Predicted visit intent (top2vec) for each web session using text descriptions of visited web pages. Found particular
interests and behaviors of customers in similar career stages.
• Currently leading the upgrade of recommendation system that uses personal data to recommend career goals.
Also working on implementation of a second recommender that outputs a series of tasks needed to achieve a
career goal using personal data.
Graduate Research/Teaching Assistant, University of Houston (Houston, TX) August 2017 – May 2021
• Developed theory of plasticity in balanced neural networks backed by large-scale simulations of networks of
10,000+ neurons in MATLAB and Python. All code is publicly accessible. Python–packaged customizable,
sample network as a pip–installable library for public use (Link to codebase).
• Simulated balanced networks under inhibitory plasticity to explain optogenetically–evoked changes in correla-
tions of local networks in visual cortex of monkeys (All code is publicly accessible).
• Peer–reviewed research manuscript submitted for publication in the Journal of Neurophysiology (Impact fac-
tor: 3.061). Provided detailed critiques and recommendations to authors and editors to significantly improve
manuscript quality.
• Taught recitation sections of various math undergraduate-level courses of 50+ students each. Led and supervised
team of 7 undergraduate students to grade first-year math homework and exams.
