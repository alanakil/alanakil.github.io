My name is Alan Akil and I am a Data Scientist at Project Management Institute. 

I'm a mathematician with extensive experience across several scientific fields: Chemical Engineering, Neuroscience, Applied and Pure Mathematics, and Data Science. 

After completing my Bachelors' degrees in Mathematics and Chemical Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, I pursued a Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Houston. During my Doctorate, I had the honor of being trained as a researcher by [Dr. Krešimir Josić](https://www.math.uh.edu/~josic/). We worked in the field of Computational Neuroscience, particularly, extending theories of plasticity in recurrent neural networks. 
My prolific time in Josić lab is evidenced by three research articles (one published, one accepted, and one in review) produced. 

As part of my training in Neuroscience, I had also taken a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Data. I worked on problems across Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning. This experience gave me the necessary tools to dive into the field of Data Science.

Today, I'm a Data Scientist at the Project Management Institute. I work on a number of high-impact projects including Customer Lifetime Value, Web Analytics, Recommendation Systems, and the development of our MLOps infrastructure. I constantly leverage on previous and recent experience on Probability and Statistical models, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Python.
