My name is Alan Akil and I am a Senior AI/ML Engineer at [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) (PMI). 

I'm a mathematician with extensive experience across several scientific fields: Chemical Engineering, Neuroscience, Applied and Pure Mathematics, and Data Science. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Houston in 2021 under the guidance of [Dr. Krešimir Josić](https://www.math.uh.edu/~josic/). We worked in the field of Computational Neuroscience extending theories of plasticity in recurrent neural networks. 
My prolific time in Josić lab is evidenced by three research articles published in peer-reviewed journals. 

As part of my training in Neuroscience, I had also taken a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and worked on several problems across Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning. This experience gave me the necessary tools to dive into the field of Data Science.

In 2021, I joined [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/) as a Data Scientist and worked on several projects including Customer Lifetime Value, Web Analytics, and Recommendation Systems. 

In early 2024, I transitioned to the role of Senior AI/ML Engineer at PMI, where I now provide technical leadership for the [Infinity](https://infinity.pmi.org/) portfolio, driving innovation across PMI's AI products.
