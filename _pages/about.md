My name is Alan Akil and I am a Data Scientist at Project Management Institute. 

I'm a mathematician with extensive experience across several scientific fields: Chemical Engineering, Neuroscience, Applied and Pure Mathematics, and Data Science. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of Houston in 2021 under the guidance of [Dr. Krešimir Josić](https://www.math.uh.edu/~josic/). We worked in the field of Computational Neuroscience extending theories of plasticity in recurrent neural networks. 
My prolific time in Josić lab is evidenced by three research articles (two published and one accepted) produced. 

As part of my training in Neuroscience, I had also taken a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and worked on several problems across Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Deep Learning. This experience gave me the necessary tools to dive into the field of Data Science.

In 2021, I joined the [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) (PMI) as a Data Scientist and worked on several projects including Customer Lifetime Value, Web Analytics, and Recommendation Systems. 

Recently, I have moved to the position of Senior AI/ML Engineer at PMI in order to support our initiatives in Generative AI.
